Manoa Menu is a full-stack web application that I helped create as part of a team project in my ICS 314: Software Engineering class in Fall 2024.

Manoa Menu is implemented using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework. Within a month, we were able to integrate the translation from English to Japanese of menus from three different UH Manoa restaurants: Campus Center Food Court, Gateway Cafe, and Hale Aloha Cafe. Support for Korean, Chinese, and Spanish will come at a later date. We also support a list of popular items, a Google Maps directory to easily find the dining locations, and a recommended list of food items alongside the option to favorite an item in your own dashboard page.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database storage, the [React](https://react.dev/) library for the user interface, and TypeScript for both client and server-side programming. I was mainly responsible for the landing page, the Google Maps location page, and the admin page. We deployed our website using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) at this link: [https://manoa-menu.vercel.app/](https://manoa-menu.vercel.app/). In the future, we hope to continue development on this project and flesh it out beyond its initial use, allowing for more languages and features to be implemented over time.
