This database user interface was created as a project for the ICS 212 class at UH Manoa. This project was the culmination of a few homeworks that we began at the beginning of the semester.

The database is implemented using the C programming language within the UNIX system. The database supports the addition of a record, printing all avaialble records, finding a specific record, deleting a sepcific record, and quitting the program.

In this project I gained experience with utilizing multiple software to organize files and write the programincluding FileZilla, PuTTY  [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
