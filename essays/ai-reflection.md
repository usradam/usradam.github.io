## Introduction

AI has made headway in education, namely though the prevalence of ChatGPT over the past couple years. It has been used to help make essay outlines or write essays completely, draft emails, create itineraries, and even code. Software engineering has seen a surge in AI applications being built and promoted, especially with integration into code editors. It has also been used to help people write code and understand it, much of which has applications for personal projects and homework. Throughout my time in my ICS 314: Software Engineering class, I have made use of artificial intelligene like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to debug my code and solve some errors in my logic.

## Personal Experience with AI

**Experience Workout of the Days (WODs)**

[WODs](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f24/morea/introduction/reading-wod-weekly-rhythm.html) I have done for homework included the use of some ChatGPT usage to help debug some statements that I have made, as it helped to speed up the process of following the logic of the code and pinpointing the errors that arised. It also helped me with CSS for experiences like [Your Choice with Bootstrap 5](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f24/morea/ui-frameworks/experience-yourchoice-bootstrap.html) in which I would ask "How could I make it so that the navbar dows not have and dileneation i.e. there is no obvvious border." It would respond with some code such as:
```css
.navbar {
    background-color: transparent; /* No background */
    border: none; /* Remove border */
    box-shadow: none; /* Remove any shadow */
}
```

However, I would like to rely less on using AI to figure out the logic as understanding the underlying functionality of your code can help to become proficient in writing similar code on your own in the future.

**In-class Practice WODs**

I made little use of AI during in-class practice WODs as there was no urgency to complete it in time for points in the gradebook. However, afterward I would sometimes have ChatGPT explain segements of the code that I had a hard time understanding.

**In-class WODs**

I would frequently use ChatGPT to help me format and fix my code, especially when it came to things like CSS styling for the in-class WODs. This helped me to position some elements on a mock website we would make when I couldn't find out how to position, for example, a block of text correctly.

**Essays**

I did not use AI to write or outline my essays as I find it to not be sufficient in the formatting that I would prefer and the choice of explanation. In this way, it can preserve my "voice" while writing and keep my mind on a linear track of thought.

**Final project**

For my final project, [Manoa Menu](https://manoa-menu.vercel.app/), I made frequent use of ChatGPT to help me with the final project for things like the aesthetics of the website like with the footer. I had a hard time coming up with some ideas for the look of the footer, so I went to ChatGPT for some ideas. This helped give me an outline and I was able to work off of it with some inspiriation from other websites I looked through.

**Learning a concept / tutorial**

I rarely used it as a tool to learn a new concept or a tutorial as I find it hard to tailor the prompt to output a specific example or learning guide. In my case, it is much faster to Google something online and learn from there, especially as some webstes embed a code playground that allows you to get familiar with the code behind a concept yourself.

**Answering a question in class or in Discord**

I did not use AI to answer a question in class or in the class Discord as I find myself too hesitant to give someone advice on the whims of an AI-generated output that I don't fully understand, possibly allowing for bad or inadequate information to be relayed.

**Asking or answering a smart-question**

AI has been of some use to help answer some smart questions although the errors that you deal with from code generated by ChatGPT leaves room for much frustration. Sometimes, it can be time-saving to go to somewhere else like Stack Overflow or a website with code examples.

**Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”**

This is one of the use cases I have used ChatGPT for, especially with some cosing problems where I do not know how I would begin to approach a problem, thus allowing me to obtain an outline to similar problems I can ask ChatGPT.

**Explaining code**

This has been one of the best use cases to me so far, as ChatGPT is able to break down code into segments and you can ask it to explain further if need be. It helps to peel away the abstraction that you may encounter and it can help you understand why something is implemented a certain way.

**Writing code**

Writing code with ChatGPT has been of some use for me throughout this semester although it is not always reliable, and if I do not understanda  concept thoroughly then it is hard for me to gauge how accurate ChatGPT's response is. In any case, it does provide some great starting points though the context that one needs to provide ChatGPT to get the code to work with other parts of your program can become too tedious.

**Documenting code**

I refrain from using ChatGPT from documenting code for the same reason I don't use it for writing essays: it is not sufficient for me in terms of formatting and specific details that would need to be recorded, all of which are unique to the thing you are tyring to document; ChatGPT generalizes this too much and it is easier for me to write the documentation from scratch.

**Quality assurance**

I made a lot of use in asking ChatGPT what was wrong with a specific part of my code or some ESLint errors that got thrown my way, as it provided quick and easy feedback, much of which provided correct solutions.

**Other uses in ICS 314 not listed**

There is not anything else I used ChatGPT for in ICS 314 that wasn't listed above.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI has been a great tool of support for me, although I continue to grow worried in my overall reliance on it for some coding applications. It is a convenient tool that can allow for auto-completions and can help to easily debug or rewrite code that contains flawed logic, but that of course does not develop any critical-thinking skills on my part. In that sense, it could cause a decline in deep knowledge that one posseses where they would not need to rely on a crutch for something to be done. However, I have found that it is something easy to rely on as it has all the free time in the world to communicate with. As such, it has helped to develop my understanding of software engineering concepts in a timely basis.

## Practical Applications

As I mentioned with my final project, Manoa Menu, AI has great practical applications in helping to build software to solve software engineering problems. It also provides great support to real-world problems, even [earning a Nobel Prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/) for its applications with physics.

## Challenges and Opportunities

As I have discussed previously, it has some limitations with only working within the context of the prompt you give it. In large scale application you may build, it would have a hard time being able to connect pieces together with the logic of one piece of code being used in another part of your application. But for isolated code blocks, it works well. AI has the opporunity to supplement software engineering education by making some of the tedious parts of coding e.g debugging become effortless in the future, allowing students to become more focused on learning new concepts and writing more code.

## Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods in software engineering education i.e. in-person lecture and hands-on activities still can not be replaced, as the face-to-face connections allows ideas to be bounced around in a more efficient manner. Plus, the learning materials will be better understood by a teacher or teaching assistant who you can go to rather than an AI who did not create the learning material.

## Future Considerations

Software engineering education looks to be interesting in the future, especially as technology advances and the number of potential software engineers grow. I think as AI advances it would begin to cause some automation of software engineering tasks that we never thought possible. Perhaps software developers will have knowledge that will become obsolete and the reliance on AI is used instead, or maybe the domain knowledge that future students are taught will change. It definitely needs some improvement in contextual understanding, but we'll see where it lies a few years from now.

## Conclusion

I think AI could be inegrated to serve as a personable assistant that you could talk with as it helps you work through problems. As the capabilites of AI assistants grow, I think it will come to be another avenue of getting help instead of just a teacher. This could lead to more isolation amongst people by blocking off a human-to-human connection, and it could even lead to the deprecication of some jobs that will be replaced by AI as a means of cost-cutting by companies. Though the future is unreliable to predict, I think AI will become advanced enough to serve as a mentor in software engineering courses, more available to everyone, virtually or physically, in stronger ways than previously thought.
