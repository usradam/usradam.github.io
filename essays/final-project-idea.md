# Project: Lost and Found Website Hub
Idea by: Adam Graham, Eric Kim, Justin Sumiye, Brendan Kuwabara, Christian Iha

## Overview

*The problem:* There are many instances in which UH students forget their belongings in a classroom or around campus facilities. There are designated rooms to check for a lost item but it is not as easy as it could be. There is no sure way of knowing at first thought if your item was stolen or you misplaced it somewhere on your person.

*The solution:* The Lost and Found Website Hub acts as a catalog in which any reported lost and found items on campus are also recorded through the website. People can easily check this website to search for current lost items that have been reported and can filter these items to quickly look for any item of theirs.

## Approach

Students may log in using their UH username and password and can browse the catalog of lost items. They can browse the catalog through designated tags or a search bar to quickly filter through the items and search for a specific item that they may have lost. They can then make a claim to a lost item and set up a pick-up day.

Students can also view if an item has been claimed and can set notifications for when a new lost item appears on the website. There would also be a provided description and picture of a lost item in the case that more than one similar item is lost at the same time.

Admins can monitor the site and update the status of an item (whether its been claimed or not), can create new postings, delete postings, and update tags and descriptions.

## Use case ideas

- User goes to landing page, logs into the website using their UH username and password, gets to home page, sets up notifications.
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, makes changes to catalog of items (description, new posting, delete a posting, etc.)
- User goes to landing page, logs in, searches and filters for a lost item, makes claim and sets pick-up day.

## Beyond the basics

- Support the lost and found items for multiple UH campuses, acting as a true central hub of lost and found items that can be used across all UH systems.
- In the scenario that a user is not on island, the user can request an extension period for the lost item to be held or can request the item to be mailed to them.
- Set up a time and date history of when exactly an item was reported lost and claimed.
