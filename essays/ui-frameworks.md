## An Alternative to Raw CSS

Web design can be a tedious process. This is exemplified in the monotonous nature of creating attractive websites with raw CSS and HTML, which involve a lot of style blocks. To cut down on this process and to streamline the development of websites, you can use UI/CSS frameworks. The frameworks function by providing a set of CSS classes and/or Javascript functions that streamline the layout development; provides an attractive look and feel; and helps with consistency across browsers. There are many frameworks out there: I am currently utilizing Bootstrap for my ICS 314 (Software Engineering) class.

## Bootstrap

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img width="225px" class="rounded pe-4" src="../img/ui-frameworks/Bootstrap_logo.svg">
  <img width="300px" class="rounded pe-4" src="../img/ui-frameworks/rwd.png">
</div>


Bootstrap is one of many UI/CSS frameworks for responsive web design (RWD) and mobile-first front-end development. In terms of mobile-first, it is a vanguard in web design with the aim of rendering pages well-suited toward mobile devices. There is no special coding required to format the UI within a mobile-sized screen. With RWD, it is the overarching idea of being able to render web pages on a variety of devices. Web pages can be viewed on laptops/computers, tablets, and phones, all of which vary in screen size and aspect ratio. The responsiveness of RWD entails being able to ensure usability and satisfactory viewing of web pages no matter the device you are using. Another great aspect of Bootstrap is the provision of tools like a set of icons in a [free library](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).


## Creating Websites

In ICS 314, we have gained experience utilizing Bootstrap through the practice of recreating website designs. We decided to break down the website components to be more simple than that of the actual website to get used to Bootstrap. Though there was the need to refer to documentation consistently, the practices were a fun endeavor that made web design less tedious. An example of a website we recreated was [Murphy's Bar & Grill](https://www.murphyshawaii.com/). My recreation can be seen below:

Bootstrap is a great utility to have when creating responsive and attractive websites without the need to slog through raw HTML and CSS. CSS frameworks in general are something I would recommend to website developers, whether that be [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), or something more minimalist like [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/).
