Going into my ICS 314 class at UH Manoa, I did not have prior experience with active web development. In practice, I only had some knowledge and familiarity with web developemnt languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I taught myself some concepts from these languages due to wanting to build my own websites, with a primary otivation of wanting to showcase statistics of my own characters from video games and even providing tips to other players. 

As I move forward with ICS 314, undertaking TypeScript has furthered my motivation of getting to know the language very well and applying it to my own projects down the road. So far it seems like a fun language to work with and I am excited to develop my skills with it.

## Experience and familiarity

I have become curious with TypeScript as it is functionally similar to JavaScript, which has allowed me to become acquainted with the syntax of TypeScript due to my familiarity with JavaScript. We started the class with some introductory modules related to JavaScript, with one exercise focusing on the ES6 version. It was good pracctice that helped me to solidify some base concepts, which carrys on over to when we started TypeScript. As we moved onto TypeScript, there was empahsis on type annotations that come with the language, which can be helpful for specifying the parameters in a function.

Working with JavaScript and TypeScript has been a good break from C and C++ that I worked with in a previous ICS 212 class since C and C++ invovles manual memory management, making debugging a bit more annoying. With that in mind and type annotations, TypeScript seems like a language that could offer more readability to a user which seems like a good fit use in software engieering. As I gain more experience with TypeScript, I am sure to gain a stronger opinion on it, but it has been an intriguing start so far.

## Athletic Software Engineering

This semester, we established a pedagogy called "Athletic Software Engineering" (ASE) which invovles timed, fast-paced technical assignments related to software engineering. A big component of ASE is through a workout of the day (WOD) which involves timed coding problems.

This is intimidating as it is an all-or-nothing points system, which forces us to be comfortable with the language and to be calm under time-constrained conditions. We have practice WODs to get acquainted with the material we have learned before our graded WOD, which I find to be useful since there is an associated video solution to follow after our attempt.

## Skill Acquisition 

I find the general premise of ASE and the WODs to be a smart approach that will be beneficial to me and other students later in life. This is especially true for job interviews that employ coding problems and for acquiring solid skills of the material, not just general concept acquisition.

As I go through the motion with the WODs and course content, I am sure to gain a good understanding of TypeScript that will carry with me throughout my career and prepare me to be comfortable in a computer science work environment.
