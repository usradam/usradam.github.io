## Preparation for the Hike

At the start of my first semester at UH Manoa, I was an exploratory student, as I had not yet decided on and declared a major. From high school, I knew I was interested in chemistry and environmental science, so I was considering degrees in the College of Natural Sciences or the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. In the meantime, I decided to fulfill my general education requirements while exploring degree pathways and talking with friends.

One of my friends, who was on the Information and Computer Sciences pathway, described his pathway as fun and interesting since he was integrating his computer science classes with creative computational media. This piqued my interest, as I was also interested in game development at the time. I branched out to other interests such as cybersecurity and, most notably, psephology (the statistical study of elections and voting trends).

## Start of the Hike

I began my sophomore year taking computer science classes after completing a significant amount of general education coursework, and my motivation to improve grew. Although I did not have prior coding experience, I became involved in clubs within the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at my school, including Grey Hats (a cybersecurity-centered club), and Programming and Algorithms (PANDA). I became more confident being around others who were also eager to develop a better understanding of computer science principles and improve their programming skills.

## Navigating the pathways: Where do I go from here?

There are many forks in the road on the computer science pathway that I am interested in exploring. As of now, my interests lie in applying data science principles mainly in the realm of psephology while also exploring the application of data science principles to climatology and creative computational media. In the meantime, I strive to develop well-rounded skills not just in data science fundamentals, but also in software engineering and cybersecurity. As I progress forward, I hope to strengthen these skills not only in the classroom but also through internships and jobs.
