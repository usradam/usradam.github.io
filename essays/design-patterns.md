Christopher Alexander was an architect and design theorist who was influential in the field of pattern language, a term coined by him in his 1977 book *A Pattern Language*.

Alexander talks of how "each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice." His influence has extended into urban design, sociology, and software.

Through design patterns, we have found that the current curvy look of automobiles allows for efficient aerodynamics since the curved exteriors of the car allows for less wind resistance and thus less gas needing to be burned to move the car.

There are various design patterns in software, with a prevalent one being the model-view-controller (MVC). When implementing a user interface, the MVC entails separaating the model (state of the system) from the way it is presented to the user; it can be thought of as your database. The view is the presentation to the user, so in the context of a web application, it would be the html and css files. The third component, control,
