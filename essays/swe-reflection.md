## Acquiring Fundamental Concepts

Throughout the semester in my ICS 314: Software Engineerng class, we have acquired some fundamental software engineering concepts that have applicability beyond the web development that we have focused on. Many of these concepts are important to have ingrained as you work on more software throughout your career. In practice, concepts like open source software development and coding standards have helped to make great strides in the development and maintenance of new and old software.


## Sharing Software for the World

Open source software development allows for the reusability of code for further development and derivative work. Much like books, source code can be copyrighted by the authors with no public availability to the code and prohibition against any use of the code itself. The distribtion may be restricted, but under open-source licenses granted by the authors, it gives the freedom to other developers to help enhance and branch off of the original work. This legal mechanism grows the open source community in which it allows users and developers to better understand how a system works; it offers transparency in how a software operates and the underlying functionality. With this, documentation of the system can grow and help with implementing feautres can be done at an expedited pace which would otherwise be restricted with a closed, smaller community of developers.


## Readable Code

Readability of code not only helps yourself remember how something you wrote functions, but also other developers who work off of your work. Coding standards, as discussed previously by me [here](https://usradam.github.io/essays/coding-standards.html), involve the use of a style guide that establishes certain conventions when writing code to allow one to better understand how a program functions and to make documentation of the code easier. In ICS 314, we were introduced to linting (code analysis tools) that flag errors such as unused variables. This has many applications beyond just web development as it affects every software one would write. When software is being developed by a large team, it is paramount to ensure that if a senior developer leaves or if a new one joins, there is no loss of information and miscommunication when it comes to being able to understand and maintain the software for continued and future work.


## Flexible Concepts for Beyond

These software engineering concepts are flexible for many different software that is developed. Although the focus in ICS 314 has been applying these concepts toward web develpoment, I have gained a lot of valuable information needed to succeed in any team-based or solo software environment.
