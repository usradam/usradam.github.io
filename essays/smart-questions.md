## Developing the Right Approach to Questions

Asking a well-constructed question will increase your chance of receiving well-constructed answers. Asking smart questions requires careful consideration of a few criteria to provoke answers from people who will not see your question as a time waste. Someone who is observant, thoughtful, and willing to learn is less likely to be neglected in a place like a forum where there are many questions that respondents can choose to answer. Following the approach by Eric S. Raymond and Rick Moen in their ["How To Ask Questions The Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) guide, it is important to take these first steps and try to find an answer to your technical question before asking it online:
1. Search archives of the forum you plan to post to or its mailing list.
2. Search the web ("Google is your friend").
3. Read the manual.
4. Read an FAQ.
5. Go through inspection and/or experimentation.
6. Ask a skilled friend.
7. If you program, try to read the source code.
