## Developing the Right Approach to Questions

Asking a well-constructed question will increase your chance of receiving well-constructed answers. Asking smart questions requires careful consideration of a few criteria to provoke answers from people who will not see your question as a time waste. Someone who is observant, thoughtful, and willing to learn is less likely to be neglected in a place like a forum where there are many questions that respondents can choose to answer. Following the approach by Eric S. Raymond and Rick Moen in their ["How To Ask Questions The Smart Way"](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) guide, it is important to take these first steps and try to find an answer to your technical question before asking it online:
1. Search archives of the forum you plan to post to or its mailing list.
2. Search the web ("Google is your friend").
3. Read the manual.
4. Read an FAQ.
5. Go through inspection and/or experimentation.
6. Ask a skilled friend.
7. If you program, try to read the source code.

## Constructing the Question

It is important to ask your question in the appropriate place. This includes choosing a forum where the question is on topic, deciding whether your question is suited for a technical or more elementary site, not cross-posting to too many places, and not asking the question to a someone's personal e-mail who you do not personally know. There a many forums dedicated to specific niches, so choosing a relevant forum from, for example, [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites) is a good place to start if you do not know where you may have the most success of getting an answer.

Next, you should make your suject header descriptive and specific. It should be easily understandable what your problem is so that another person with a similar question can look at your post instead of needing to create a new one. In general, the subject header should contain an "object" that specifies the thing having a problem and a "deviation" that describes the unexpected output/behavior. 

For the body of the message, try to proof read it to be clear, gramatically correct, and no spelling-errors. Also provide a brief synopsis of your problem's symptoms in chronological order and your ultimate goal. Then describe the step/steps that your are stuck on.
